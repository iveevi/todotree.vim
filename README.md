# todotree.vim

A Neovim function to view all the `TODO`s in your current buffer.

## Setup

Copy the contents of `todotree.vim` into your `init.vim` and copy `todos.lua` into the `lua` directory of your Neovim config.

All that is left afterwards is to map keys of your preference to the `TodoTree(<height>)` function.
